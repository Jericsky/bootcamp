//JSON Objects
/*
- JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
- JSON is also used in other programming languages hence the name JavaScript Object Notation
- Core JavaScript has a built in JSON object that contains methods for parsing JSON objects and converting strings into JavaScript objects
- JavaScript objects are not to be confused with JSON
- JSON is used for serializing different data types into bytes
- Serialization is the process of converting data into a series of bytes for easier transmission/transfer of information
- A byte is a unit of data that is eight binary digits (1 and 0) that is used to represent a character (letters, numbers or typographic symbols)
- Bytes are information that a computer processes to perform different tasks
- Uses double quotes for property names
- Syntax { "propertyA": "valueA", "propertyB": "valueB", }
