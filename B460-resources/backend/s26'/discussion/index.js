//[SECTION] Truthy and Falsy

    - In JavaScript a "truthy" value is a value that is considered true when encountered in a Boolean context
    - Values are considered true unless defined otherwise
    - Falsy values/exceptions for truthy:
        1. false
        2. 0
        3. -0
        4. ""
        5. null
        6. undefined
        7. NaN
*/
// Truthy Examples

    - Expressions are any unit of code that can be evaluated to a value

// [SECTION] Conditional Ternary Operator
/*
- The Conditional (Ternary) Operator takes in three operands:
        1. condition
        2. expression to execute if the condition is truthy
        3. expression to execute if the condition is falsy
    - Can be used as an alternative to an "if else" statement
    - Ternary operators have an implicit "return" statement meaning that without the "return" keyword, the resulting expressions can be stored in a variable
    - Commonly used for single statement execution where the result consists of only one line of code
    - For multiple lines of code/code blocks, a function may be defined then used in a ternary operator

    Syntax:
    (expression) ? ifTrue : ifFalse

//[SECTION] Switch Statement
/*
    - Can be used as an alternative to an if, "else if and else" statement where the data to be used in the condition is of an expected input
    - The ".toLowerCase()" function/method will change the input received from the prompt into all lowercase letters ensuring a match with the switch case conditions if the user inputs capitalized or uppercased letters
    - The "expression" is the information used to match the "value" provided in the switch cases
    - Variables are commonly used as expressions to allow varying user input to be used when comparing with switch case values
    - Switch cases are considered as "loops" meaning it will compare the "expression" with each of the case "values" until a match is found
    - The "break" statement is used to terminate the current loop once a match has been found
    - Removing the "break" statement will have the switch statement compare the expression with the values of succeeding cases even if a match was found
    Syntax:
    switch (expression) {
        case value:
            statement;
            break;
        default:

//[SECTION] Try-Catch-Finally Statement
/*
    - "try catch" statements are commonly used for error handling
    - There are instances when the application returns an error/warning that is not necessarily an error in the context of our code
    - These errors are a result of an attempt of the programming language to help developers in creating efficient code
    - They are used to specify a response whenever an exception/error is received
    - It is also useful for debugging code because of the "error" object that can be "caught" when using the try catch statement
    - In most programming languages, an "error" object is used to provide detailed information about an error and which also provides access to functions that can be used to handle/resolve errors to create "exceptions" within our code
    - The "finally" block is used to specify a response/action that is used to handle/resolve errors
