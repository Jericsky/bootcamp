# 240823 - B460: Academic Reading List

### **Topics**
- Express.js - Model Design
Link: https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html

### **Purpose**
- Try to run your own server.

### **Activity 1**
1. For this review activity, let us simulate a scenario of an e-commerce web application.
2. Have FOUR major data models.
3. Next identify which fields are needed by each data model.
4. Draw your ERD using diagrams.net
5. Save the screenshot of your ERD in your folder.

### **Activity 2**
1. Create appropriate folder structures to follow the separation of concerns.
2. Follow proper naming convention.
3. Input proper dependencies and modules.
4. Connect your MongoDB atlas to have your server running.
5. Use port 3000.

### **Activity 3**
1. Identify the main entities in your e-commerce application such as Product, User, Order, etc.
2. Determine the attributes for each entity. For example, a Product entity might have attributes like name, price, description, etc.
Design the Database Schema:

3. Based on the identified entities and attributes, design the database schema.
4. Choose an appropriate database system (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) for storing your data.
5. Create schemas using a schema definition language or ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library such as Mongoose for MongoDB.

### **Activity 4**
1. Write model classes or functions for each entity to interact with the database.
2. Define CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for each model.
3. Ensure data validation and sanitation to prevent security vulnerabilities and maintain data integrity.

### **Activity 5**
1. Establish relationships between different entities if necessary (e.g., a User may have multiple Orders).
2. Define how these relationships are represented in your database schema and models.
3. Write unit tests to verify the functionality of your models.
4. Test CRUD operations, validation, and relationships to ensure they work as expected.

### **Activity 6**
1. Create routes and controllers in your Express.js application to handle HTTP requests.
2. Utilize the model functions within your controllers to perform database operations.
3. Implement appropriate error handling and response formatting.
4. Use tools like Postman to send requests to your API endpoints.
5. Verify that the API responses are correct and the database is being manipulated as expected.

### **Activity 7**
1. Refactor your code as necessary to improve readability, maintainability, and performance.
2. Optimize database queries and operations for better scalability and efficiency.
3. Screenshot your postman and save it in your file.
